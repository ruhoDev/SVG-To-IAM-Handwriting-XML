"""
A QPaintDevice which, when painted with vector input, collects the line
segments drawn.

Qt's QPainter infrastructure makes it really easy to implement new back-ends
and Qt even provides default method implementations which handle the most
complex drawing commands (e.g. Beziers, Text etc.) converting these into
straight line segments.

The backend implemented in this module may be used along with QSvg to turn SVG
documents into lists of line segments ready for cutting/drawing with a plotter.
